-------------PRE and POST INCREMENT/DECREMENT-------------
==> In this we study about the increments and decrement which is
    known as the pre and post increment. This is used in a for looping.


a++ -> post increment
a-- -> post decrement  
++a -> pre increment
--a -> post decrement

As we know they use in a loop which is known as the "for" loop.

1.POST INCREMENT/DECREMENT
=>In this we do like example
(a++)-->in this first the we read the number then increment.
(a--)-->in this first the we read the number then decrement.

2.PRE INCREMENT/DECREMENT
=>In this we do like bellow
(++a)-->in this first we increment then we read the number.
(--a)-->in this first we decrement then we read the number.
